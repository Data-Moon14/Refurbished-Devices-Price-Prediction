# Refurbished-Devices-Price-Prediction

The goal was to develop a pricing model for used electronic devices by accurately predicting their used price. This is achieved by building a linear regression model that identifies the important device features that significantly influence resale price. The insights obtained will provide a data-driven action plan for ReCell's pricing, inventory acquisition, and marketing strategies.
